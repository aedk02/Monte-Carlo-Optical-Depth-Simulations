# Monte-Carlo-Optical-Depth-Simulations
Simulator to test the effect of optical depth on photon scattering through a uniform density sphere of radius 1m 

We assume:

- the sphere is illuminated by a central isotropic point source of radiation
- photons travel at the speed of light
- the scattering albedo is unity (ie. no absoprtion)

We create histograms where photons are binned according to their total time of flight in the sphere.
